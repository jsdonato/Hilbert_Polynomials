# Lambda Partition finder and Saturated Ideal counter algorithms.
This code base has two functionalities, the first being that given a polynomial 
p(d), the algorithm in this code base will return an associated lambda partiton 
if p(d) is indeed a Hilbert polynomial and the user provides a reasonable upperbound.  
In addition, if p(d) is indeed a hilbert polynomial then if n=1 or n=2 the code 
will also output the number of saturated ideals associated with p(d).  Now if the 
user only wishes to input a lambda partition and seek the number of saturated 
ideals associated with that partiton the user has that option as well.

## Algorithm
### Lambda partition finder
Before diving directly into how the algorithm functions we will first recall the
following theorem

### Saturated Ideal Counter
